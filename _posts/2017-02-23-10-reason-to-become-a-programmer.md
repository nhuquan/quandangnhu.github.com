### 1. Because anyone can do it, and so do you.

Programming is actually not as hard and complex and you think it is. Let's do the test:

*Given th wat you are holding two ball in your hands, one blue and one red. When you open the right hand, you the the red ball. Then what color of the ball in your left hand?*

If your answer is *blue*, then you can do programming. Otherwise, you might have to find another jobs. And that's it, programming is all about logic. It's basically just a sequence of conditions to solve a problem. If you're good at logic, you'll be good at programming.

Programmer can have many different background. I've seen programmer who was doctor, pharmacist, physicist, architect, mechanic, teacher, economist, etc.. I believe that there are ex-farmers programmer but i haven't got the chance to meet yet. So if you're wandering `can i do this ?`, the answer is **yes**.

### 2. And you can make a living from it!

I'm almost 28 y/o and during my time on earth till now, i have never seen a programmer who couldn't find a job. All of my friends who studying programming end up to have a job in this field. You might think be all of my fiends are excellent people, but the stats is saying the same.

Especially in our condition as a Vietnamese, finding a decent job these day is not easy at all. Even harder if you're living in the north and the best hope for jobs is Hanoi. To explain the reason why a decent job is hard to find in Vietnam, it takes a whole new post to cover. I'm just saying that programming is one of the easiest way to make money for a living that is completely legitimate. I can do it, so do you.

### 3. And you can even make a lot of money!

I assume that you already know some of the rich people who is programmer. If you don't, there are the bosses of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Linkedin, etc.. they were all programmer at the beginning. When you start working as a programmer, depending on where you're but i am pretty sure that you can have a good starting point in salary. For example, if you're in Vietnam, the entry level salary can very from 6.000.000Vnd (200$) to 10.000.000Vnd (300$). Which is quite good given the fact that the average salary is just 100$/m. The maximum amount of money you can make is actually no-limit.

### 4. It only need one skill to success

It's persistence. Never give up. When you want to do something, don't stop until you get what you wanted. And since in IT, everything is doable, you're ensured that you'll achieve the goal, there are only a matter of time, so be patient and keep working until it's done.
By the way, this quality is needed on everything in life, so it's also a good practice to train your skill in IT and then you can profit the result in others aspect of your life. It can only be better.

### Conclusion

Given all that reasons, if you're looking for a direction in your life, learning to work with computer might suite you. Human will be more and more depends on computer, so this line of job is secure in long term. Just give it a try and do your best, you might even love it, as i did =D

Peace!
